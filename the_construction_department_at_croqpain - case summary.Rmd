# **The Croq 'Pain Case Study: Strategic Analytics in Action** <br><br>

**Part 1**<br> Michel Boutillon was presented with an intriguing
challenge. The company, known for its delightful bakeries, was poised to
expand, but the question of 'where?' loomed large. With a blend of
curiosity and determination, Michel embarked on a quest to find the best
new locations for Croq 'Pain's stores, guided by a wealth of data from
60 existing locations.<br><br>

**Part 2**<br> Michel's first task was like assembling a puzzle from the
past. He meticulously developed a regression model using data from the
first 50 stores, aiming to retrospectively predict the success of the 10
stores opened in 1994. This step was crucial; it was not just about
numbers but about understanding the story behind each store's
performance and the customers they served.<br><br>

**Part 3**<br> Having honed his model, Michel turned his gaze to the
future. He expanded the model to include data from all 60 stores,
transforming it into a more comprehensive tool. This enhanced model was
his crystal ball, offering insights into which of the ten potential
locations for 1996 would not only meet but potentially exceed Croq
'Pain's performance expectations.<br><br>

**Part 4**<br> As Michel concluded his analysis, he composed a
memorandum for the Croq 'Pain leadership. This document was more than a
collection of data points; it was the culmination of his journey,
insights, and recommendations. Michel explained the strengths and
limitations of using regression models in location selection,
emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that considers both data
and market dynamics.<br><br>

**Part 5**<br> With Michel's recommendations in hand, Croq 'Pain was now
better equipped to make informed decisions about its expansion. Michel's
journey through the layers of data not only provided a roadmap for the
company's growth but also highlighted the importance of analytical
thinking in strategic business decisions. His story stood as a testament
to the power of a single individual's expertise in shaping a company's
future.
